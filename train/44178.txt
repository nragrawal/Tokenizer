Note:
This is a list of cricketers who have captained the Bangladeshi Under-19 cricket team for at least one Under-19 One Day International. The table of results is complete to the third Under-19 ODI against England in 2004. Bangladesh's greatest success in the Under-19 World Cup has been winning the plate, which is the competition for teams failing to progress past the first qualifying round of the Under-19 World Cup. They achieved this in both 1997/8and 2003/4, and during the latter tournament, beat Australia in doing so.
The ICC Trophy is the leading one-day tournament from non-Test teams, and Bangladesh participated in the tournament before they gained Test status. This is a list of the men who captained Bangladesh in the ICC Trophy.
