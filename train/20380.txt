The West Indian cricket team toured England from मे १२ to जुलै ७ इ.स. २००७ as part of the २००७ English cricket season. The tour included four Tests, two Twenty२० international matches and three One-Day Internationals. While England dominated the test series ३:०, including a record victory of the West Indies, the latter took the ODI series २:१.
In the ICC Test Championship, England are ranked second and West Indies are ranked eighth, though England's most recent series was a whitewash loss in the Ashes against Australia for the first time since १९२१, their first Test series loss since their tour of Pakistan in २००५. West Indies, meanwhile, lost ०–२ to Pakistan in नोव्हेंबर २००६ as their last Test series, and have not won a Test since एप्रिल २००५. The last time West Indies won an away Test to a nation currently ranked above them was on their tour of England in २००० – they've also beaten Zimbabwe and Bangladesh twice during these seven years.
The ICC ODI Championship sees England ranked just ahead of West Indies, as seventh and eighth respectively, though West Indies are more competitive in ODIs. They finished fifth and sixth in the Super Eight stage of the recent World Cup, with England finishing ahead of West Indies by virtue of their one-wicket win. West Indies, however, reached the final of the Champions Trophy in ऑक्टोबर २००६, and defeated India ४–१ in a home series in मे. England also acquired one ODI series win in the past year, defeating Australia in the final of the २००७ Commonwealth Bank Series, their first series win abroad since १९९८. They were, however, defeated ०–५ at home by Sri Lanka in जून, as well as drawing २–२ with Pakistan.

England started well getting the early wicket of Devon Smith in the third षटक, but a good partnership between क्रिस गेल and शिवनारायण चंदरपॉल, producing a २nd wicket partnership of ७७ gave West Indies a strong platform. England then got two quick wickets of Chanderpaul and Samuels in the space of १५ deliveries to put the game in the balance. West Indies solidified their position however with Runako Morton and क्रिस गेल putting on ८५ in the ४th wicket. Quick batting from Dwayne Bravo ensured that the West Indies set a good score of २८९/५ at the end of the innings and England needed २९० runs to win.
क्रिस गेल got passed the ६००० run mark in ODI with his boundary of the १६.२ षटक.
