The second Afro-Asian Cup was played from जून ६ until जून १०, इ.स. २००७, hosted by भारत. The ३ ODI and १ Twenty२० matches were broadcast live on ESPN, after Nimbus had pulled out from the deal with Asian Cricket Council. The Twenty२० match did not have official status as a Twenty२० international or a regular Twenty२० match.
एशिया एकादश claimed the first शीर्षक in the competition's history, following a tied series in २००५, with a ३-० whitewash of the African XI. Asian XI captain माहेला जयवर्दने was named खेळाडू of the tournament for his २१७ runs, including a half century and a century, in the ३ ODIs.
