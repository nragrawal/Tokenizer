मणिमेकलै, written by Seethalai Saathanar, is one of the masterpieces of Tamil literature and is considered as one of the five great epics of Tamil literature. Manimekalai is a sequel to Silapathikaram and tells the story of the daughter of Kovalan and Madhavi.  
As a continuation of Silappatikaram, this epic describes how Manimekalai, the daughter of Kovalan and Madhavi, followers of Jainism, takes up social service as the primary aim of her life and how she sacrifices her entire life for the same cause. 
Manimekalai is set in both Tamil Nadu and in Nainatheevu, Jaffna Peninsula in modern श्रीलंका. The story runs as follows. Manimekalai is on the verge of marrying a prince, when she is abducted and taken to an island "Manipallava Theevu" by her fairy God Mother known as "Manimegala Theivam". There she comes across "Arughar" and she acquires the enchanted "aaputhiran kai amutha surabhi" - a cornucopia bowl. She uses this bowl to feed "Kayasandigai", a cursed Yaksha who is suffering from "Yaanai - Thee " disease - an eating disorder caused due to excessive desire to eat. After this, Manimekalai is brought back to Tamil Nadu, where she uses her bowl to feed the needy.
Manimekalai - The daughter of Kovalan and Madhavi, who was born with bravery and virtues.
Udhayakumaran - The Chola King, who was madly in love with Manimekalai. He was a foolish king, who wanted things done the way he wanted them to be done.
Sudhamadhi - Manimekalai's most faithful and trustworthy friend.
