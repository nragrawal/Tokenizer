This is a list of Bangladeshi One-day International cricketers. A One-day International, or an ODI, is an international cricket match between two representative teams, each having ODI status, as determined by the International Cricket Council . An ODI differs from Test matches in that the number of overs per team is limited, and that each team has only one innings. The list is arranged in the order in which each player won his पहिला एकदिवसीय सामना cap. Where more than one player won his पहिला एकदिवसीय सामना cap in the same match, those players are listed alphabetically by first name. 
सांख्यिकी फेब्रुवारी २८, इ.स. २००७ रोजीची आहे.
