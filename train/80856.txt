The Men's Doubles tennis competition at the २००८ उन्हाळी Olympics in Beijing was held from August 10 to August 16 at the Olympic Green Tennis Centre. The DecoTurf surface rendered the event a hardcourt tournament. Matches were best-of-3 sets, except for the final which was best-of-5 sets. Tiebreakers were not played in the final set.
The results returned स्वीडन and the United States to the medals stand for the first time since the event's re-introduction in Seoul. The gold awarded to Federer/Wawrinka was the first medal for Switzerland in this event.
