As of 30 Mar 2017 the total fleet size of commercial airlines in India is 439. In 1994 the Air Corporation Act of 1953 was repealed with a view to remove monopoly of air corporations on scheduled services, enable private airlines to operate scheduled service, convert Indian Airlines and Air India to limited company and enable private participation in the national carriers. However, beginning 1990 private airline companies were allowed to operate air taxi services, resulting in the establishment of Jet Airways and Air Sahara. These changes in the Indian aviation policies resulted in the increase of the share of private airline operators in domestic passenger carriage to 68.5% in 2005 from 0.4 of 1991.
Current market share of Indian carriers in the domestic aviation market is shown below:
